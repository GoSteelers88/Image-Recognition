## Introduction
This repository contains Python code for classifying the CIFAR-10 dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented in Keras. The primary objective is to showcase an end-to-end data science solution, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Project Structure
The project consists of a single Python file containing the following steps:
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
2. Model Building
3. Model Training
4. Model Evaluation
5. Making Predictions

## Dependencies
* Python 3.x
* Numpy
* Keras

## Installation Guide
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies

## Usage
Run the Python file in your IDE or from the command line: `python filename.py`

## Data Description
The model is trained and tested on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

### Preprocessing
* Normalization: Pixel values are scaled between 0 and 1
* Label encoding: Categorical labels are one-hot encoded

## Algorithms and Methods

### CNN Architecture
1. Convolutional Layer with 32 filters and (3, 3) kernel size, RELU activation
2. Convolutional Layer with 32 filters and (3, 3) kernel size, RELU activation
3. Max Pooling Layer with pool size (2, 2)
4. Convolutional Layer with 64 filters and (3, 3) kernel size, RELU activation
5. Convolutional Layer with 64 filters and (3, 3) kernel size, RELU activation
6. Max Pooling Layer with pool size (2, 2)
7. Flatten Layer
8. Fully Connected Layer with 512 nodes, RELU activation
9. Output Layer with 10 nodes, Softmax activation

### Optimizer
Adam optimizer is used with categorical cross-entropy loss function.

## Model Validation and Metrics

### Training
* Batch size: 64
* Epochs: 10

### Metrics
* Test loss: Provides the value of the loss function for the test data
* Test accuracy: Gives the classification accuracy on the test data
